# AI-Memoria: Persistent Memory System

> Capture and reuse project learnings across all future projects

## 🎯 Overview
AI-Memoria is a persistent memory system that captures valuable patterns, workflows, and learnings from your projects and makes them reusable in future work. Inspired by Google Antigravity's "persistent memory" concept.

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS
- **Milestone:** 1 complete (7/7 tasks)
- **Branch:** memory
- **Tests:** 10/10 passing
- **Patterns:** 6 captured
- **Last Updated:** 2026-02-08

## 🚀 Milestones

### ✅ Milestone 1: MVP Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Tasks 1-7: Full TDD implementation of both extractors
- Test Suite: 9 unit tests + 1 integration test
- Patterns: 6 patterns captured (manual + auto)
- Validation: All patterns validate against schema

### 🎯 Milestone 2: Antigravity Integration (NEXT)
Phase 1: Pattern Activation - Make patterns executable
Phase 2: Context-Aware Retrieval - Smart filtering based on project context
Phase 3: Progressive Disclosure - Show simpler patterns first, complex as needed
Phase 4: Automated Application - Apply patterns automatically when appropriate
