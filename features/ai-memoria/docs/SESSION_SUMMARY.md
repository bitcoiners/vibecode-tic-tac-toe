## Scope Expansion:
Updated plan to include extraction of ALL workflow rules and processes, not just project learnings.

### Now includes:
1. Project-specific learnings (code patterns, architectural decisions)
2. Workflow rules (git standards, coding standards, quality gates)
3. Tooling & automation (scripts, templates, configurations)
4. Best practices & anti-patterns (what works, what to avoid)
