### Define the Core Problem & Vision

**A live, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game for smart phones. Two friends can instantly start a game by sharing a link, taking turns on a simple 3x3 grid until one wins or the game draws.**
    

### Define the Target User & Core Use Case

**User:** 
A person who wants a quick, fun, and familiar game to play with a friend remotely.

**Core Use Case:** 
Sarah is waiting for a bus. She texts a game link to her friend Alex. Alex opens the link on his phone. They immediately see the game board and take turns during their wait. The game provides a perfect 2-minute distraction.
