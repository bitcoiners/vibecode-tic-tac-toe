### **Vibe Coding Tic-Tac-Toe Project - Continuation Document**

**Project Status:** Successfully authenticated with GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code. Ready to begin vibe coding.

#### **1. Project Overview**
- **Project:** A live, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe PWA (Progressive Web App) for mobile phones.
- **Core Concept:** Two friends share a link to instantly play a turn-based game in their mobile browsers.
- **Development Methodology:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) foundation, transitioning to AI-assisted "vibe coding" using GitHub Copilot Chat.
- **Current Phase:** PHASE 2 - Building the `GameClient` (View) module. PHASE 1 (Core `GameEngine` logic) is complete.

#### **2. Project Architecture & Key Files**
The application follows an MVC-style architecture adapted for a PWA.

| Component | Module | Status | Key Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model (Logic)** | `GameEngine` | **COMPLETE** | `src/gameEngine.js`, `tests/gameEngine.test.js` |
| **View (UI)** | `GameClient` | **IN PROGRESS** | `src/gameClient.js` (to be created), `index.html` |
| **Controller (Network)** | `GameSync` | Pending | `src/gameSync.js`, `server.js` (future) |
| **PWA Shell** | Config | Pending | `manifest.json`, `service-worker.js` (future) |
| **Documentation** | - | Complete | `docs/TECHNICAL_BLUEPRINT.md`, `README.md` |

#### **3. Completed Work: The `GameEngine` (Core Logic)**
- **State Representation:** A `gameState` object manages `board` (flat array), `currentPlayer`, `status`, and `winner`.
- **Public API:** Four fully tested, working functions:
    1.  `makeMove(cellIndex)`: Places mark, validates moves, switches turn, checks win/tie.
    2.  `getState()`: Returns the current game state.
    3.  `resetGame()`: Resets state to initial values.
    4.  `checkGameStatus(board)`: Pure function detecting wins/ties.
- **Verification:** All unit tests in `tests/gameEngine.test.js` are passing (`npm test`).

#### **4. Immediate Next Task: Build the `GameClient` (View)**
**Objective:** Create the UI module that renders the game board and interacts with the `GameEngine`.

**The next prompt to give GitHub Copilot Chat is:**
```
I am building a live, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe PWA for mobile phones. I have already planned the project and built the core game logic with Test-Driven Development.

**Project Context:**
- **PRD & Blueprint:** All features and architecture are documented in my `docs/TECHNICAL_BLUEPRINT.md` file.
- **Game Engine:** The `src/gameEngine.js` module is complete and fully tested. It exports `makeMove`, `getState`, `resetGame`, and `checkGameStatus`.
- **Tests:** All tests in `tests/gameEngine.test.js` are passing.

**Your Task: Create the GameClient (View) Module.**
1.  Create a new file: `src/gameClient.js`.
2.  It must import the `gameEngine` to get state and make moves.
3.  It must render a 3x3 grid of tappable cells that works on mobile.
4.  It must display game status messages (e.g., "Player X's turn", "X Wins!").
5.  It must re-render the entire UI when the game state changes.
6.  Please use plain, modern JavaScript (no frameworks) and CSS for styling.

Please write the code for `src/gameClient.js`. Start by showing me the code. Ask me questions if anything is unclear.
```

#### **5. Workflow for Vibe Coding with Copilot**
1.  **Prompt:** Provide clear, context-rich instructions (like the prompt above).
2.  **Review & Test:** Examine the AI-generated code. Run `npm test` to ensure core logic remains intact. Open `index.html` in a browser to check functionality.
3.  **Iterate:** Use the chat to request fixes or enhancements (e.g., *"Make the board grid use CSS Flexbox for better mobile responsiveness"*).
4.  **Commit:** Once a feature works, commit changes to Git (e.g., `git commit -m "feat: add GameClient via Copilot"`).

#### **6. Future Steps (After `GameClient` is Complete)**
1.  **Integrate `GameClient`** with a basic `index.html` file.
2.  **PHASE 3 Prompt:** *"Now, create the `GameSync` module for live multiplayer using Socket.io. Set up a basic Node.js server with Express in `server.js` and create `src/gameSync.js` to sync the `gameEngine` state between two browser tabs."*
3.  **PHASE 4:** Add PWA configuration (`manifest.json`, `service-worker.js`) for installability and offline support.

#### **7. Environment & Tooling**
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu.
- **AI Tool:** GitHub Copilot Chat (unified extension). Authentication is now active.
- **Test Framework:** Jest (`npm test`).
- **Version Control:** Git repository connected to GitHub.
