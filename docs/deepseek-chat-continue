Updated: Vibe Coding Tic-Tac-Toe Project - Continuation Document
Project Status: PHASE 2 COMPLETE. The GameClient is built, fully tested, and integrated. The game is locally playable. Ready for Phase 3: Live Multiplayer.

1. Project Overview
Project: A live, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe PWA (Progressive Web App) for mobile phones.

Core Concept: Two friends share a link to instantly play a turn-based game in their mobile browsers.

Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD) foundation, transitioning to AI-assisted "vibe coding" using GitHub Copilot Chat.

Current Phase: PHASE 3 - Building the GameSync (Network) module. PHASE 1 (Logic) and PHASE 2 (UI) are complete.

2. Project Architecture & Key Files
The application follows an MVC-style architecture adapted for a PWA.

Component	Module	Status	Key Files
Model (Logic)	GameEngine	COMPLETE	src/gameEngine.js, tests/gameEngine.test.js
View (UI)	GameClient	COMPLETE	src/gameClient.js, tests/gameClient.test.js, index.html
Controller (Network)	GameSync	NEXT	src/gameSync.js, server.js (to be created)
PWA Shell	Config	Pending	manifest.json, service-worker.js (future)
Documentation	-	Complete	docs/TECHNICAL_BLUEPRINT.md, README.md, docs/deepseek-chat-continue
3. Completed Work: The GameEngine & GameClient
GameEngine (Model): Fully tested. Manages game state with board, currentPlayer, status, winner. Exports makeMove, getState, resetGame, checkGameStatus.

GameClient (View): Newly Complete. Mobile-responsive UI with CSS Grid. Imports gameEngine, renders tappable cells, displays status, and auto-renders on state changes (polling). Includes a "Reset" button.

Verification: All 36 unit tests are passing (19 for GameEngine, 17 for GameClient). Run npm test.

Integration: Game is fully playable locally. Serve with python3 -m http.server 8000 and open http://localhost:8000.

4. Immediate Next Task: Build the GameSync (Multiplayer)
Objective: Create the network module that enables two players on different devices to share a game state in real-time.

The next prompt to give GitHub Copilot Chat is:

Now implement the live multiplayer feature (M6 from the PRD). We need to sync game state between two browsers.

**Project Context:**
- **Game Engine:** `src/gameEngine.js` is complete (getState, makeMove, resetGame).
- **Game Client:** `src/gameClient.js` is complete and renders the UI.
- **Goal:** Two players share a link to join the same game room.

**Your Task: Create the GameSync (Network) Module.**
1.  Create a backend file: `server.js`. Use Express and Socket.io.
2.  Create a frontend module: `src/gameSync.js`.
3.  The system should:
    - Allow a player to "Create a game," generating a unique room ID/URL.
    - Allow a second player to "Join a game" via that URL.
    - Sync all `makeMove` actions and the full game state between both clients in real-time.
    - Handle player disconnection gracefully.
4.  Integrate `gameSync.js` with the existing `gameClient.js` so the UI works over the network.

Please outline the plan first, then write the code. We must keep all existing tests passing.
5. Workflow for Vibe Coding with Copilot
Prompt: Provide clear, context-rich instructions (like the prompt above).

Review & Plan: The AI should outline its approach first. Review this architecture.

Generate & Test: The AI will generate code. Run npm test to ensure core logic is intact. Test the new server and client connection manually.

Iterate: Use the chat to request fixes (e.g., "The game state is not syncing after a win. Please ensure the status and winner are broadcast.").

Commit: Once the multiplayer works between two browser tabs, commit the changes.

6. Future Steps (After GameSync is Complete)
PHASE 4: Add PWA configuration (manifest.json, service-worker.js) for installability and offline support.

Enhancements: Add the "Should Have" features: score tracking and player role display.

7. Environment & Tooling
IDE: Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu.

AI Tool: GitHub Copilot Chat (unified extension). Authentication is active.

Test Framework: Jest (npm test). All 36 tests passing.

Version Control: Git repository connected to GitHub. Recent commit: Phase 2 completion.
