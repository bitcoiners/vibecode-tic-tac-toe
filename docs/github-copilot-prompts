I am building a live, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe PWA for mobile phones. I have already planned the project and built the core game logic with Test-Driven Development.

**Project Context:**
- **PRD & Blueprint:** All features and architecture are documented in my `docs/TECHNICAL_BLUEPRINT.md` file.
- **Game Engine:** The `src/gameEngine.js` module is complete and fully tested. It exports `makeMove`, `getState`, `resetGame`, and `checkGameStatus`.
- **Tests:** All tests in `tests/gameEngine.test.js` are passing.

**Your Task: Create the GameClient (View) Module.**
1.  Create a new file: `src/gameClient.js`.
2.  It must import the `gameEngine` to get state and make moves.
3.  It must render a 3x3 grid of tappable cells that works on mobile.
4.  It must display game status messages (e.g., "Player X's turn", "X Wins!").
5.  It must re-render the entire UI when the game state changes.
6.  Please use plain, modern JavaScript (no frameworks) and CSS for styling.

Please write the code for `src/gameClient.js`. Start by showing me the code. Ask me questions if anything is unclear.
