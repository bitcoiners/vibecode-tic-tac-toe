# Development Roadmap

## Milestone 1: MVP (Week 1)
**Goal**: Basic extraction and storage working

### Tasks:
1. [ ] Define complete data schemas (including workflow rules)
2. [ ] Create knowledge base directory structure
3. [ ] Build simple git history extractor
4. [ ] Build workflow document extractor (GIT_WORKFLOW.md, CODING_STANDARDS.md, etc.)
5. [ ] Create manual extraction template
6. [ ] Test with current project data AND workflow documents
7. [ ] Document the extraction process

### Success Criteria:
- Can manually create 5 knowledge entries from project learnings
- Can extract 3 workflow rules from existing documents
- Basic directory structure exists
- Extraction template is usable for both learnings and workflows

### Success Criteria:
- Can manually create 5 knowledge entries
- Basic directory structure exists
- Extraction template is usable

## Milestone 2: Automation (Week 2)
**Goal**: Semi-automated extraction pipeline

### Tasks:
1. [ ] Build chat log extractor
2. [ ] Create generalization transformer
3. [ ] Implement categorization logic
4. [ ] Build validation checks
5. [ ] Create storage system
6. [ ] Add search index

### Success Criteria:
- Pipeline can process chat logs
- Extracted data is properly generalized
- Can search knowledge base by tag

## Milestone 3: Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Integrated with development workflow

### Tasks:
1. [ ] Create Git pre-commit hook
2. [ ] Build weekly review script
3. [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
4. [ ] Create project templates
5. [ ] Build usage documentation
6. [ ] Add to existing projects

### Success Criteria:
- Learning extraction happens automatically
- New projects get memory system by default
- Team can easily find and use patterns

## Milestone 4: Enhancement (Week 4+)
**Goal**: Intelligent features and scaling

### Tasks:
1. [ ] Add AI pattern matching
2. [ ] Build cross-project analytics
3. [ ] Create maturity scoring
4. [ ] Implement feedback system
5. [ ] Add visualization dashboards
6. [ ] Optimize search performance

### Success Criteria:
- System suggests relevant patterns
- Can track pattern usage across projects
- Performance metrics visible
