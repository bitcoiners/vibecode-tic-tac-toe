# External Knowledge Integration Example

## Source: everything-claude-code repository

### Source Pattern:
"Use the "thinking step-by-step" prompt pattern for complex problems"

### Extracted Principle:
**Category**: AI Prompting / Problem Solving
**Pattern**: Step-by-Step Reasoning Prompt
**Core Idea**: Break complex problems into sequential reasoning steps
**When to Use**: Complex algorithms, debugging, architectural decisions

### Generalized Implementation:
\`\`\`markdown
## AI Prompt Pattern: Step-by-Step Reasoning

### Template:
\`\`\`
I need to solve [problem]. Lets think step by step:

1. First, understand the core requirements...
2. Then, identify constraints and edge cases...
3. Next, brainstorm possible approaches...
4. Evaluate each approach based on [criteria]...
5. Choose the best approach and implement...
6. Finally, validate and test...
\`\`\`

### Benefits:
- Forces systematic thinking
- Reduces cognitive load
- Makes reasoning process explicit
- Easier to debug and refine

### Variations:
- For debugging: "Lets trace through the code execution step by step"
- For design: "Lets design this system component by component"
- For learning: "Lets understand this concept layer by layer"
\`\`\`

### Integration with Our Workflow:
- Add to AI interaction templates
- Include in code review checklists
- Use in technical decision documentation
- Train team members on the pattern
